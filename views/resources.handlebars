        In Canada, income tax is administered by the Canada Revenue Agency
        (CRA). The Canadian income tax year is from January 1 to December 31. If
        you owe income tax, you must pay it by April 30 for the previous
        calendar year. Late submissions are accepted, but there may be a
        penalty. If you are employed in Canada, your employer must withhold and
        remit to the CRA statutory deductions from your wages.
